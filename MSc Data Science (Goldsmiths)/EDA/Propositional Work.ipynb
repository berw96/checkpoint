    "<h2>Overview</h2>\n",
    "<h3>The Project</h3>\n",
    "<p align = \"justify\">My project is about the effects of the <b>Russo-Ukrainian War</b> on both Russia and <b>NATO</b>'s defense budgets, and gas and oil prices throughout the European Continent.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Russo-Ukrainian War</h3>\n",
    "<p align = \"justify\">On February 24th 2022, forces from the <b>Russian Federation</b> invaded <b>The Ukraine</b> from its Eastern borders. In the months following, four oblasts (regions) - <b>Donestk</b>, <b>Kherson</b>, <b>Luhansk</b> and <b>Zaporizhzhia</b> - were formally annexed and absorbed, along with <b>Crimea</b> (annexed 2014), into the Russian Federation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align = \"justify\">Ongoing, the Russo-Ukrainian War is the greatest conflict on European soil since the Second World War (with combatants including the <b>United States</b>, the <b>British Empire</b> and the <b>Soviet Union</b> against the <b>Third/Greater German Reich</b>), with this status stirring deepened concerns from the Western forces of NATO and allies.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Russia-NATO tensions</h3>\n",
    "<p align = \"justify\">The North Atalantic Trade Organisation or NATO was founded in the light of WW2 in April of 1949 as an oppositional state between the Western nations - of democratic, capitalist orientation - and the rival Eastern nations (including Russia) of authortarian, socialist/communist orientation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align = \"justify\">Throughout the Cold War (1947-1991) and up until today, tensions have remained consistent between the two ideologies, and for nearly a decade since 2014 these tensions have been particularly present between Russia and NATO (with the USA spearheading the organisation's stance in the world). The tensions are partly geopolitical, stemming from the presence of NATO in the EU and former USSR states (Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, etc), and Russia's assaults on Ukraine. It is these tensions which serve as ground to explore correlation between the two side's military budgets, and the energy prices in Europe which have risen significantly due to Russian sanctions.</p>"
